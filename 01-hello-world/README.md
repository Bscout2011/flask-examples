Example 1
=========

This example shows a simple Flask application. 

Run the application with `python3 hello.py`. Use a web browser to navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. "Hello World!".
Now interact with the web page with the extension `/user/<name>` where the `<name>` is a variable you can change.
